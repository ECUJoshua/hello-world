# hello-world
The first creation!

I am sitting at the kitchen island watching the battle of the bands!
Tigers mauling tigers in the Bayoooou. 


Now in Wilmington, Camille threw up in the car tonight.
Also, I wrote a short Python script out of memory. Not really memory.
I used what little knowledge I have to make something out of CODE.
